    <h2>MIT App Inventor 3.1 and 3.2</h2>
    <p><font face="verdana"color="purple">In this assignment, I got to create my
    own app using my phone. For assignment 3.1 I downloaded the MIT AI2 Companion
    app on my phone and decided to play around with the app features. I was able 
    to make my phone speak any phrase and was able change the background to a 
    beach which is my favorite place of all time.In assignment 3.2 I had the task of 
    making the voice speak while shaking my phone. I had to shake my phone while
    at the same time the voice was saying "Stop shaking me. This task was fun 
    because I got to make the voice say anything while shking it."</font></p>
